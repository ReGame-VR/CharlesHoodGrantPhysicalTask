-Duck Antennas: worked, but didn't improve distance

-Pros: worked, but significant delay (failed at 12,13 secs)

49A IS THE COORDINATOR
	
ASCII acknowledge character

get acknowledgement before moving on

160 bits per message

9600 bits per second

try 50 ms delay, repeated 5 times

either send until matlab says it has received 
or add check to matlab for target # at beginning 

check digi if there is pre-programmed settings for ack

xctu: check differences in settings (addressing) between
series 1 and pro

make timeout longer in matlab, maybe arduino

CODE STUFF FOR TRANSMITTING ASCII ACK/NAK:
int thisByte = 33;
Serial.write(thisByte);

String incoming;
if(Serial.available()>0){
incoming = Serial.read();
String mysrr = String(incoming);
Serial.println(mysrr);

look into whether the micro usb converter (Serial1) could be a source
of dropped signal
