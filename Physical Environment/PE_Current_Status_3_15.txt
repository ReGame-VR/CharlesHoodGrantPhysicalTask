PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT CURRENT STATUS (3/15/19)


SOUND:
-there was a 'delete(instrfindall)' that was removing the sound player object
-moved this to the beginning of the code
-sound should work now as long as sound files are correctly placed

HK - Changed comparisons @Line 864 and 870 from string type 
"if (value == '1')" to numeric  "if (value == 1)" to match received 
data. sounds playing now


SAVING:
-code for setting up the cop data and saving it is set
-code for setting up the excel file for the trial is set up
-need to manipulate data collected and send to excel file in correct format
-need to add code that will append the excel file(s) after trials


SCORE DISPLAY:
-need to change gui code so that the new data is added instead of zero value
-the variables being displayed are 'trial_score' and 'cum_score'
-the figure for the scores is called 'scorefig'
-tried adding code (line 877 or so) but haven't tested yet
-need to set up the code so that trial_score and cum_score are taking in the new values
from 'score'
-Need to figure out how to make the score gui pop up before the task starts so that
it can be dragged onto the monitor for feedback. Currently the score gui pops up as 
the task start dialogue opens, so you can't drag the gui over to the secondary monitor
before the task is already running.


GREEN/YELLOW TIME:
-need to add loops for each color that will:
-check what color zone the COP is in
-when the COP enters the zone, start timing
-when the COP leaves the zone, end timing
-add up all the time differences to find total time in the green/yellow zone

HK - Added ticks_in_{green,yellow,red} variables, and increment them in each 
     loop based on COG position, i.e. if cog is in red area, increment ticks_in_red,
     if its in yellow, increment ticks_in_yellow, etc.

     Since each loop iteration is 'cycletime' seconds, the ticks_in_$COLOR counters 
     can be converted back to time just by multiplying by 'cycletime'.

     did some testing, cycletime not accurate but this works:
     
     time_in_green = ticks_in_green * (t_el / (ticks_in_green + ticks_in_yellow + ticks_in_red))
     added at Line 891

SCREENS FREEZING:
-still having issue with screens getting stuck
-attempts at adding error correction seem to have not made a difference
